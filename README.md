This application lets the user search for events that are happening given an input location.
The user can also give keywords to reduce the amount of unwanted results. These results are obtained using the Eventful API.
Some information about each event is given, such asthe title, the date, the venue where the event will be held, the location of
this venue and a description. If the user is interested in an event, he can share it via his platform
of choice or save it. He can view his saved events and delete events from this list if he is no longer interested in them.
